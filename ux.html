          <p>When it comes to thinking about UX, I look for anything extraneous that impacts my cognitive load, stops
             my momentum, or leaves me confused. When I look at a project, I really try and listen to my gut when I
             come up against a UX flaw. Am I offended? Why?</p>

            <div class="box3"><div class="text-container"><br>This is the current version of Zonder's badges screen before any retouching. Some user issues with this
              layout are: Lots of vertical whitespace = wasting space - Over 20 badges means lots of scrolling - Tracking progress of bottom badges
                difficult - Titles for each badge are redundant - The images, however, tell a good story. Their hexagonal shape made me think
              of a beehive. This is what inspired me to create a "honeycomb" redesign of this page. </div></div></div></div>

              <div class="box3"><div class="text-container"><br>My first iteration of the honeycomb idea is shown left. Making it in this layout, I had a goal to fit
              all the badges on the screen at once; after showing this design to Zonder's CEO, I was told we need to make room for future badge additions. But we were
            getting closer. From here, we decided on adding the following to the next iteration: Use their Figma assets to create bronze, silver, and gold badges - 
          Go larger and do 3 or maybe 4 badges wide - Allow for vertical scrolling to see more badges. </div></div></div></div>

            <div class="box3"><div class="text-container"><br>3x4 design is motivated by allowing the user to achieve Gold Badge Streaks. Here, the user has a gold badge streak of 
              5. The user could achieve a gold badge streak of 8 by achieving a gold badge instead of a bronze badge on row #2
              with the flower on it. Or they could instead achieve a gold badge streak of 9 by achieving 2 gold badges on row #5. </div></div></div></div>

            from this mock-up created in Adobe Illustrator. The final major change was to enlarge the badge which is currently selected, with a small drop shadow 
            to create a slight 3D effect. </div></div></div></div>
